In this implementation, AI agents (birds) learn to play the game by evolving neural networks over generations. Each bird's neural network adapts to the game environment through evolution, using survival time and score as performance metrics. Since the game mechanics are relatively simple, the model can adapt and perform well within 3â€“5 generations when using a population of 50 birds per generation. This population size can be adjusted for better results, making the system versatile and efficient.",
